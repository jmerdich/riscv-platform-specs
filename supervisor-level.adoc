## Supervisor-Level Platform

* Supervisor-mode environments must implement at least version 0.2.0 of the
  RISC-V SBI specification, which can be found at
  https://github.com/riscv/riscv-sbi-doc/blob/v0.2.0/riscv-sbi.adoc
* Supervisor-mode environments must implement the Sv39 page-based
  virtual-memory scheme.   Systems that support Sv48 must support Sv39, systems
  that support Sv57 must support Sv48, and so forth.
* Unless otherwise specified by a given I/O device, I/O regions are at least
  point-to-point strongly ordered.  All devices attached to a given PCIe root
  complex are on the same ordered channel (numbered 2 or above), though
  different root complexes might not be on the same ordering channel.
* On RV64I-based Unix-class systems the negative virtual addresses are reserved
  for the kernel.
* External devices (DMA engines, the debug unit, non RISC-V cores, etc) that
  are visible to RISC-V harts must appear as coherent agents, just like any
  RISC-V hart would.  If additional ordering constraints are necessary for a
  device to function, those will be provided by a device-specific mechanism.
